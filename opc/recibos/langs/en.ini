  <br>
  As usual, the ICRAV Organizing Committee <strong>has negotiated good accommodation</strong> rates  and <strong>good rates for the Conference  facilities</strong> for the 2016 ICRAV to be held in-house at the Sheraton  Hotel;&nbsp;dependent upon&nbsp;sufficient delegates staying there.&nbsp; However, if the  number of rooms booked at the hotel is not sufficient, due to delegates staying  outside and enjoying the benefits of the Conference facilities at the Sheraton,  the financial consequences on the host country would be very difficult to  address. <br>
  <br>
  Thus we strongly encourage you to stay at the  Sheraton for the period of the Conference For those accommodated at the Sheraton, <strong>the hotel will provide</strong> American style  buffet breakfast at Las Carretas restaurant, four lunches during the Conference,  free WiFi in all rooms and  WiFi at  Conference rooms.<br>
  <br>
  Also for delegates and accompanying persons staying  at the Sheraton the following <strong>leisure  facilities</strong> will be available: indoors swimming pool, sauna, jacuzzi and  gym, a 50% discount is available for the green fee at the nearby Golf Club. The  hotel also has direct Access to Punta Carretas Shopping Mall.<br>
  <br>
  We kindly ask  you register for the Conference and reserve accommodation at the Sheraton  before the <strong style='color:#0070c0'>30th June 2016</strong>. <br>
  For any  delegate <u>staying outside</u> the Sheraton Hotel a <u>Surcharge</u> of <strong>US$</strong> <strong>500</strong> will apply. This Surcharge contributes towards the use of the  Conference facilities, Wi-fi at Conference room, four lunches and organization  outgoings.<br>
If you still  wish to stay off-site, for any part of the conference, please carefully check  and complete the registration and hotel booking form. <br>
